- Properties files are used to store configuration related data which can be changed frequently as unlike a Java class file, 
  recompilation is not needed if the information is changed from a properties file.
- These files internationalizes Java code by making the code locale-dependent.

** There are multiple ways to read properties file.
- Using properties class inside of java.util package
- Using JavaResourceBundle
- We can also use any other third party library like Apache commons
